How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Helped a lot

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Version control is a must. Can save you a lot of time. Also, you can "release" official version
    and backtrack to old versionof your code;

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros : More control. No possible of file collision. You chose when to commit so it can you can do it after a logical change. 
    Cons : more complicated... learning curve

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Save time with Git. It makes sense to commit all the files in your repository because they are interconnected one to the other ;

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

	git log gives you the time and date a file has changed
	git diff give you the difference between two files 
    Git log give you an unique id that you can copy paste to compare two files with git diff, very
    easy to compare with the +/- and the color

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You can "undo". YOu can buid you project pieces by pieces and track back all your changes.
    Very useful to be sure nothing bug

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Let's make some project !
